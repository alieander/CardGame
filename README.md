CardGame
========

This game probably has a better name but I am not sure what it is... so I called it CardGame...(creative right?)

GamePlay
========
* Pick a Magic Card and say its whole name out loud.
* Someone else has to pick a card that <b>Starts</b> with the <b>Last</b> letter of the card named.
* Repeat without reusing cards.

Example
=======
I say __Mother of Runes__. The next person could say __Snapcaster Mage__. After that could be __Erase__... and so on until you get board.
I made this site to help me out when I (or whomever I am playing with) get stuck!
